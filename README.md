# step project "Forkio"

## Description
My colleague and I created an adaptive website "Forkio" based on the given design. The tasks were divided in advance, so we simply chose who would work on which part.

*Oleksandr* worked on the assignment for student number 1:
- The website header;
- The navigation menu (including the dropdown menu);
- The "People Are Talking About Fork" section.

*Vlada* worked on the assignment for student number 2:
- The Revolutionary Editor block;
- The "Here is what you get" section;
- The "Fork Subscription Pricing" section.

## Technologies used
The project was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and to build the project we used "gulp" and its plugins:

- gulp
- gulp-sass
- browser-sync
- gulp-js-minify
- gulp-uglify
- gulp-clean-css
- gulp-clean
- gulp-concat
- gulp-imagemin
- gulp-autoprefixer
